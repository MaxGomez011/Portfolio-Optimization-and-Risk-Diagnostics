# Portfolio-Optimization-and-Risk-Diagnostics
This project develops a multi-asset equity portfolio using classical mean–variance optimization and advanced risk diagnostics. Assets were selected across growth, financial, defensive, and commodity exposures to evaluate diversification under realistic market conditions.

The analysis includes:

- Annualized return and volatility estimation

- Covariance and correlation structure analysis

- Sharpe-maximizing portfolio construction

- Risk contribution decomposition (Euler framework)

= Historical and parametric VaR and CVaR comparison

- Benchmark comparison against equal-weight allocation

Results show that the Sharpe-optimized portfolio improves risk-adjusted performance without increasing historical tail risk, while revealing structural risk concentration through component risk analysis.
